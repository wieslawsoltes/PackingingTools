**Pre-MVP Tasks**
- Wire real telemetry into the dashboard (completed): plan still called out “next connect to live pipeline telemetry events” (`docs/packaging-tools-plan.md:147`), yet the GUI seeded fake data and the CLI used a console-only channel. The shared `DashboardTelemetryStore` now backs CLI/SDK/Avalonia, pipelines emit `pipeline.completed`/artifact events, and the GUI loads persisted snapshots so the dashboard reflects real jobs.
- Deliver enterprise identity providers (completed): architecture docs expect Azure AD/Okta SSO and MFA (`docs/identity/identity-architecture.md:1-56`). Azure AD and Okta providers now back `IdentityServiceFactory`, tokens persist via the secure store, CLI (`identity login`) and Avalonia UI expose sign-in commands, and policy evaluation enforces required roles/identity presence.
- Finish remote signing connectors promised for Windows (completed): Azure Key Vault signing now routes through `AzureKeyVaultSigner` with remote credential properties, CLI wizard surfaces the configuration, and integration tests cover the remote path.
- Turn on the documented SBOM and vulnerability features (completed): Linux DI now registers `CycloneDxSbomGenerator` and `TrivyVulnerabilityScanner`, the pipeline selects generators via `security.sbom.format`/`security.vuln.provider`, and integration tests assert SBOM files and vulnerability findings are produced.
- Bootstrap the plugin system that the vision leans on (completed): plugin contracts, loader, and adapters now register through a shared `PluginManager`. CLI/SDK probe defaults (`%APPDATA%/PackagingTools/plugins`, `./plugins`), `plugins.directories` project metadata, run-option overrides, and the `PACKAGINGTOOLS_PLUGIN_PATHS` environment variable; the Avalonia workspace exposes an editor for project plugin paths. Integration tests assert manifests load in SDK flows, and refreshed docs cover manifest format and configuration knobs.
